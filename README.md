## 🔍 Explainable Credit Risk Modeling – German Credit Dataset 

### 🧠 Project Overview 
This project implements an end-to-end credit risk analysis pipeline using the
Statlog (German Credit) dataset, with a strong emphasis on explainable AI (XAI).
The goal is to build predictive models for credit risk while providing clear,
interpretable explanations of their decisions.

The project progresses from exploratory data analysis to model training and
evaluation, followed by global and local explainability using
interpretation techniques.

### 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Statlog (German Credit Data)
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Samples:** 1,000
- **URL**: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data]
- **Features:** 20 (categorical and numerical)
